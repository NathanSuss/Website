# Nathan Programs - Personal Website
Development of this site is still in its early stages. Once I have a more firm grasp of how to use Vue.js, I intend to present projects I undertake - accompanied by documentation, notes, and tutorials which could help another programmer learn the same way I did. The first project I plan to exhibit is the website itself.
